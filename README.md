# Glucose Prediction Android App

## Features
- It lets an user create a new glucose level entry for the current hour
- It lets an user see their history of glucose vs hour

## Next steps
- Make a background service that makes a request to the [Prediction API](https://github.com/Auto-Learning-BioTech/Glucose-Prediction) every hour to get the predicted status of the glucose level at the current date
- Let the users register themselves in the application in order to have actual custom data
